# Strikethrough Text Examples

This document shows how strikethrough formatting works in Markdown.

## Basic Strikethrough

This text has ~~strikethrough~~ formatting applied to one word.

Here's a sentence with ~~multiple words struck through~~ in the middle.

## Combined Formatting

You can combine strikethrough with **bold** like this: ~~**bold strikethrough**~~

Or with *italic* formatting: ~~*italic strikethrough*~~

And even with `code`: ~~`code with strikethrough`~~

## Multiple Strikethrough Sections

This sentence has ~~one strikethrough~~ and then ~~another strikethrough~~ separated by normal text.

## Complex Example

In this paragraph, we demonstrate how ~~strikethrough can be **combined** with *various* other~~ formatting options in a ~~single~~ sentence.

## In Lists

1. Normal item
2. Item with ~~strikethrough text~~
3. ~~Entire item strikethrough~~

## Notes

Strikethrough is commonly used to:
- Show ~~deleted~~ content
- Indicate ~~outdated~~ information
- Mark items as ~~completed~~ in task lists
