# Design Principles

## Consistency Matters

> **Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.**
> 
> *â€” Steve Jobs*

This principle reminds us that:

> Aesthetic appeal must be balanced with **functional excellence**. 
> Users appreciate *intuitive interfaces* over flashy gimmicks.

## User-Centered Approach

As we often repeat in our team:

> Start with the **user experience** and work backward toward the technology.
>
> Remember that *simplicity* is the ultimate sophistication.
